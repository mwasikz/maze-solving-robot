## :orange_circle: Maze Solving and Object Picking Robot Using Artificial Intelligence

The robot is programmed to drive over the black or white lines of the maze and use optical sensors on the bottom of the robot to track the lines. As it travels along, the program we are using will solve the maze for the shortest path with a simple to understand method called the "Right/Left Hand Rule". There is a programmable interface that can be used to change the hand to either or left or right. In the programmable interface it is also possible to change the type of tracks, i.e. black line on white surface or white line of black surface. The bot is programmed to determine it's speed based on the path. When the bot senses there is a straight line ahead, it will automatically increase it's speed to the maximum.  

The robot also has a mechanical hand to pick objects. The hand is created using simple strings and a servo motor.
