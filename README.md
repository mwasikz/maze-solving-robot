## :orange_circle: Maze Solving Robot

The robot is programmed to drive over the black or white lines of the maze and use optical sensors on the bottom of the robot to track the lines. As it travels along, the program we are using will solve the maze for the shortest path with a simple to understand method called the "Left Hand Rule" or sometimes called the "Left Hand on Wall" method. We have used an advanced algorithm to increase motor speed to maximum on its return. 

The robot also has a mechanical hand to pick objects. The hand is created using simple strings and a servo.
